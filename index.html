                    <p class="lead">In the last years, Rust has become a popular programming language. Many use it, even more are eager to learn it. Linz has
                        meetups for many programming languages, but Rust has been missing - and that is about to change.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>We are thrilled to announce the launch of a Rust meetup in Linz.</strong></p>
                    <p>The goal is to bring together people who are using Rust or who are curious and want to learn about it. We invite everybody to contribute
                        short talks about the Rust programming language or related technologies. It might be an interesting feature you discovered, a project
                        you have been working on, a finding of yours from a real-world project, a Rust-related book that you want others to know about, anything
                        that you want to contribute to the local Rust community is welcome. Before and after the talks there will be time for informal chatting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Because of the current Covid-19 situation, the <strong>Rust meetup Linz will happen online in the foreseeable future</strong>. On the
                        long run, in-person meetups with streaming of the delivered talks are planned.</p>

                    <h3>Thursday, August 6, 2020 17:30 MESZ - Kick Off</h3>
                    <p>In the last years, Rust has become a popular programming language. Many use it, even more people are eager to learn it. Linz has meetups
                        for many programming languages, but Rust has been missing - and that is about to change. On August 6th, 2020, we will kick-off the
                        regular Rust Meetup in Linz. Because of current times, the meetup will be VIRTUAL.</p>
                    <p>We are proud to welcome a very special guest for our first-ever Rust meetup: RYAN LEVICK. Ryan is Cloud Advocate for Microsoft. He has
                        been writing Rust since around version 0.10. Ryan now focuses on Rust full time at Microsoft. When he's not doing Rust, he enjoys
                        cooking, traveling, and exploring Berlin where he lives.</p>
                    <p>Our second speaker of the evening is RAINER STROPEK. Rainer is chairman of the Coding Club Linz and co-founder of the Rust meetup in
                        Linz. Rainer has been exploring Rust for some months and would like to share his learnings about Cargo, Rust's package management and
                        build tool.</p>

                                        <p>It seems like most developers these days have heard about Rust, but many are still wondering if the language is
                                            relevant to them. In this talk, we'll explore why learning Rust might be of interest to you.</p>

                                        <p>C# has NuGet, Java has Maven, JavaScript has npm - and Rust has Cargo. Cargo is a package manager and build-tool. In
                                            this session, Rainer Stropek will introduce Cargo and demonstrate how to use it when building Rust applications.
                                            This will be an introductory talk for people who are rather new to Rust.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Do you want to deliver a talk at the *Rust* meetup Linz? Great! [Please enter your suggested topic in
                        Sessionize.](https://sessionize.com/rust-linz/)</p>
                    <p>If possible, talks should be delivered in English. If you are not comfortable speaking English, German is an option, too. *Rust* is still
                        a rather young language. Thus, not many people consider themselves as *Rust* experts. Because of this, we are not just looking for deep
                        dive content. Introductory sessions are great, too, so that beginners, students, and hobbyists have the opportunity to start their
                        *Rust* journey. <strong>You do not need to be a Rust pro to talk at our meetup!</strong> If you have something Rust-related to share
                        that you are passionate about, we would love to have you as a speaker.</p>
