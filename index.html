                    <p>In the last years, Rust has become a popular programming language. Many use it, even more are eager to learn it. Linz has meetups for
                        many programming languages, but Rust has been missing - and that is about to change.</p>
                    <p><b>We are thrilled to announce the launch of a Rust meetup in Linz.</b></p>
                    <p>The goal is to bring together people who are using Rust or who are curious and want to learn about it. We invite everybody to
                        contribute short talks about the Rust programming language or related technologies. It might be an interesting feature you discovered,
                        a project you have been working on, a finding of yours from a real-world project, a Rust-related book that you want others to know
                        about, anything that you want to contribute to the local Rust community is welcome. Before and after the talks there will be time for
                        informal chatting.</p>
                    <p>Because of the current Covid-19 situation, the <b>Rust meetup Linz will happen online in the foreseeable future</b>. On the long run,
                        in-person meetups with streaming of the delivered talks are planned.</p>

                    <p>Do you want to deliver a talk at the *Rust* meetup Linz? Great! [Please enter your suggested topic in
                        Sessionize.](https://sessionize.com/rust-linz/)</p>
                    <p>If possible, talks should be delivered in English. If you are not comfortable speaking English, German is an option, too. *Rust* is still
                        a rather young language. Thus, not many people consider themselves as *Rust* experts. Because of this, we are not just looking for deep
                        dive content. Introductory sessions are great, too, so that beginners, students, and hobbyists have the opportunity to start their
                        *Rust* journey. <b>You do not need to be a Rust pro to talk at our meetup!</b> If you have something Rust-related to share that you are
                        passionate about, we would love to have you as a speaker.</p>
